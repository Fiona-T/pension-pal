*Note: this website was created for educational purposes as a student of Code Institute, and the website described below is a fictional one.*

PensionPal is a website for users in Ireland to record details of their working life and private pensions so that the information is in one location and easy to access when it comes to retirement. Tracking the information along the way, e.g. on leaving employment, is much easier than trying to find it years later at retirement age.

## Purpose
---
The purpose of PensionPal is to allow users to record the details of their working life and private pensions in one single location. The aim is for users to record these details at the time, e.g. when finishing up in a job, while the information is to hand and fresh in their minds, rather than having to find this information years later at retirement age. When they get to retirement age, then all the information is easily accessible, making the process of drawing down the retirement benefits much simpler.

The initial iteration of PensionPal allows users to record employments, and record "defined contribution" pension schemes related to these employments. It can be extended in the future to allow more complex records: "defined benefit" occupational pension schemes, self-employed details, and can be extended further as outlined in the [Future Features section](#future-features).

The target audience are employees of any age, working in Ireland (pension features differ in different countries, and the information to be recorded is specifically based on Irish pensions). Employees who are not part of a pension scheme are still part of the target market, because they can still record their employment details (which can be used at a later date to determine eligibility for the State Pension Contributory), and it may also help them to learn some information about pensions so that they might set one up.

### User’s goals:
- Users want to be able to record details of their employments, and the pension (if any) attached to their employment
- Users want to be able to add more records over time, as they start and finish different jobs, with different pensions attached
- Users want to be able to view the records they have added over time, edit a record if any information was incorrect or needs to be updated, or delete the record completely if they added it in error

### Site owner’s goals:
- Provide a place for registered users to easily record the details of their employments, and attached pensions
